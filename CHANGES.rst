1.8 (2016-04-16)
================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug with daylight saving time adding one hour to each event during DST.

- Normalize non-recurring events to UTC to fix possibly wrong local time zone
  values. **Caution:** Some events could not be fixed because they already have
  a wrong time with the UTC time zone. But only some of the events with a UTC
  time zone seem to have this offset. These ones have to be fixed by hand.
  Sorry for the inconvenience.

- Listing of recurring events in calendar master data no longer displays a time
  for whole-day events.

Features
--------

- Add a special style sheet for printing to render the calendar as a list on
  paper. (Works in Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome and
  Internet Explorer >= 10.x)
