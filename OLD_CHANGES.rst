================

  The previous functionality of ``get_events()`` is now provided by
  ``get_events_for_month()``

- Move ``.browser.renderer.interfaces.IEventDescription`` and
  ``.browser.renderer.interfaces.UnknownLanguageError`` to
  ``.browser.interfaces``.

Features
--------

  (See Master data > Calendar > List views for the configuration.)


Other changes
-------------

- Adapt code to `icemac.addressbook >= 6.0`.


2.3 (2017-12-26)
================

- Add breadcrumbs.

- Fix rendering of month list:

  + day numbers in calendar for read-only users are now the same size as for
    r/w users.

  + the dots in front of text when rendering multiple items per event no longer
    overlap with previous text.

  + when printing it is rendered like the month calendar.

- Fix printing view of month list to render the event title first and align
  day numbers right.

- Fix printing view of year calendar to render each month on a single page.

- Change `zope.interface.implements[Only]` and `zope.component.adapts` to
  class decorators.

- Adapt the code to `icemac.addressbook >= 5.0`.

- Also release as wheel.


2.2 (2017-05-16)
================

Features
--------

- Add a month list view which looks like the print version of the month view.

Bug fixes
---------

- Allow to delete a recurred event and put a new event with the same category
  into its place. Before this fix the new event might not be displayed.


2.1.1 (2017-04-09)
==================

- Fix icons of links introduced in version 2.1 to be rendered equally on
  Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Chrome.


2.1 (2017-04-08)
================

Features
--------

- Add links in month view to easily access the previous resp. next month.

- Rename the links to the month view and to the year view and add titles to
  them.


Other changes
-------------

- Bring the test coverage to 100 % including the tests itself and the test
  infrastructure but without the need to run the selenium tests to achieve
  this.

- Update to changes in test infrastructure in `icemac.addressbook >= 4.0`.


2.0 (2017-02-04)
================

Backward incompatible changes
-----------------------------

- Update test infrastructure to `icemac.addressbook >= 3.0`, thus update to
  `py.test >= 2.8`. The fixtures which can be reused where moved to
  ``icemac.ab.calendar.fixtures``. ``icemac.ab.calendar.conftest`` should no
  longer be used from foreign packages as this leads to problems with the new
  py.test version.


Bugs
----

- The computation of Biweekly events was fixed: There are now always two weeks
  between the events. Previously it could only be one if the recurrence in the
  previous month was in the last week of the month.

- Fix the bug with daylight saving time adding one hour to each event during
  DST for the year calendar which was already fixed for the month calendar in
  version 1.8.


1.12 (2017-01-21)
=================

- Adapt code so `grokcore.component >= 2.6` can be used.

- Fix sort order of events with the same datetime again. They are now
  sorted by the title of the category.

- Adapt styling to `icemac.addressbook >= 2.10`.


1.11.2 (2017-01-09)
===================

- Stabilize the sort order of events with the same datetime. They are now
  sorted by category.


1.11.1 (2017-01-07)
===================

- Fix an error in calendar display when rendering a user defined field which is
  only defined on IEvent but not on IRecurringEvent.


1.11 (2017-01-06)
=================

- Bring branch test coverage to 100 %.

- Adapt code and role configuration to `icemac.addressbook >= 2.9`.


1.10 (2016-08-28)
=================

- Add some infrastructure for `icemac.ab.calexport`.


1.9 (2016-06-25)
================

- Allow to restrict which persons are listed in the person list on the event
  using: Master Data > Calendar > Settings > Person keyword.

1.8 (2016-04-16)
================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug with daylight saving time adding one hour to each event during DST.

- Normalize non-recurring events to UTC to fix possibly wrong local time zone
  values. **Caution:** Some events could not be fixed because they already have
  a wrong time with the UTC time zone. But only some of the events with a UTC
  time zone seem to have this offset. These ones have to be fixed by hand.
  Sorry for the inconvenience.

- Listing of recurring events in calendar master data no longer displays a time
  for whole-day events.

Features
--------

- Add a special style sheet for printing to render the calendar as a list on
  paper. (Works in Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome and
  Internet Explorer >= 10.x)

--------

  error when displaying recurred events.

Other
-----

- No longer use `unittest2` as it was included in Python 2.7.

- Lint JS code.

- Use py.test as new test runner.

- Use package `icemac.recurrence` which was extracted for reuse from here.


1.6.0 (2014-12-16)
==================

- Add new recurrences for recurring events:

  * biweekly,
  * nth weekday of month,
  * nth weekday every other month
  * nth weekday from end of month
  * nth weekday from end of other month
  * yearly

- Display actual recurrences in recurrence event listing in master data.

- If there are two reccurred events matching in date, time and category only
  the one is rendered thats recurring event occurres more seldomly.

- Day numbers are now add-links to create a new event for the day.
